# fsfibu2
An older project of mine: A java-based bookkeeping software I wrote for the Mathematics student council at the TU Kaiserslautern
(and as of this day -- June 2016 -- they appear to be still using it...).
I'm not maintaining this code in any way (if you're a member of the Kaiserslautern math student council and you're having trouble with fsfibu2,
you can write me an email, though... ;-)
Some documentation can be found in the doc/ folder. There is a manual and a javadoc (I think I actually annotated quite a lot of the code back then...)
